# pangram-game
This program is a game that picks a pangram out of a dictionary and scrambles
the word. It writes the word to an output file, called ".answer" by default.

A "pangram" is a word that uses seven unique letters.
A "perfect pangram" is a seven-letter word with only unique letters.

Run the script with `python3 pangram.py`.
The dictionary file and pangram characteristics are configurable.
Run `python3 pangram.py --help` for more info.
